First, I wish to show my appreciation to the Research Grants Council of Hong Kong, under the aegis of the University Grants Committee of Hong Kong, for providing financial support under the Hong Kong Ph.D. Fellowship Scheme.
I would also like to thank The Hong Kong Polytechnic University for supporting the research study and, more specifically, the Department of Applied Mathematics for providing the necessary equipment and research facilities.

I wish to extend my special thanks to Prof.\ Xiaojun Chen and Dr.\ Zaikun Zhang from the Department of Applied Mathematics of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University for supervising the research study.
Their patience and motivation helped me to overcome the challenges I faced during my studies.

The assistance provided by Prof.\ Serge Gratton from the Department of Applied Mathematics of Toulouse INP/ENSEEIHT and Prof.\ Ya-xiang Yuan from the Institute of Computational Mathematics and Scientific/Engineering Computing of the Chinese Academy of Sciences was greatly appreciated.
They shared beneficial commentaries on the research project and showed everlasting encouragement and support.

Finally, I would like to thank my parents and my sister for their wholesome counsel, wise guidance, and sympathetic ears during the research study, and my friends, for always being by my side, providing invigorating discussions along with resourceful distractions.
