First, I would like to express my deepest gratitude to Prof.\ Xiaojun Chen and Dr.\ Zaikun Zhang from the Department of Applied Mathematics of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University for supervising this thesis.
Their patience and motivation helped me to overcome the challenges I faced during my study.

The support and encouragement provided by Prof.\ Serge Gratton from the Department of Applied Mathematics of Toulouse INP/ENSEEIHT and Prof.\ Ya-xiang Yuan from the Institute of Computational Mathematics and Scientific/Engineering Computing of the Chinese Academy of Sciences are greatly appreciated.
They shared beneficial comments on my research projects and helped me through my research studies.

Words cannot express my gratitude to my parents and my sister for their wholesome counsel, wise guidance, and sympathetic ears during the research study, and my friends, for always being by my side, providing invigorating discussions along with resourceful and necessary distractions.

Finally, I would like to extend my sincere thanks to the Research Grants Council of Hong Kong, under the aegis of the University Grants Committee of Hong Kong, for providing financial support under the Hong Kong Ph.D. Fellowship Scheme.
I also thank The Hong Kong Polytechnic University for supporting the research study and, more specifically, the Department of Applied Mathematics for providing the necessary equipment and research facilities.
