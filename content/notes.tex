\chapter{Some notes to include in the thesis}

\section{Maratos effect}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \citeauthor{Maratos_1978} first observed in his Ph.D.\ thesis the Maratos effect occurring in line-search \gls{sqp} methods~\cite{Maratos_1978}.
    \item This defect of the line-search and trust-region \gls{sqp} methods was overcome by several techniques, including nonmonotone line-search techniques~\cite{Chamberlain_Etal_1982}, \gls{soc} techniques~\cite{Colman_Conn_1982a,Colman_Conn_1982b,Fletcher_1982,Fukushima_1986,Mayne_1980,Mayne_Polak_1982}, and the use of differentiable exact penalty functions~\cite{Powell_Yuan_1990}.
\end{itemize}
