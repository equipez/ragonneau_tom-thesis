\chapter{Interpolation models for \glsfmtlong{dfo}}

We mentioned in \cref{ch:introduction} that model-based \gls{dfo} methods necessitates to approximate locally the functions involved in an optimization by simple functions.
Examples of such functions are polynomials and \glspl{rbf}.
In this chapter, we focus on linear and quadratic polynomials.
We denote by~$\lpoly$ and~$\qpoly$ the spaces of respectively linear and quadratic polynomials on~$\R^n$.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Linear models~$\lpoly$, quadratic models~$\qpoly$, RBF models, \dots
    \item Definition of interpolation and regression.
    \item Let~$\mathcal{Y} \subseteq \R^n$ be the interpolation set.
    \item Dimensions of~$\lpoly$ and~$\qpoly$.
    \item Because of the dimensions of these space, we focus on interpolation models.
\end{itemize}

\section{Elementary concepts of multivariate interpolation}
\label{sec:multivariate-interpolation}

\begin{itemize}
    \item What is a simplex gradient? (needed in the introduction).
    \item Bases of~$\lpoly$ and~$\qpoly$.
    \item Poised set for interpolation.
    \item Characterization of the poisedness with bases.
\end{itemize}

\section{Overview of the Lagrange polynomials}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Definition of the Lagrange polynomials.
    \item They are well-defined if the interpolation set is poised.
    \item The Lagrange polynomials form a basis.
    \item Lebesgue constant and extension by~\cite{Ciarlet_Raviart_1972}.
    \item Interpretation of the absolute value of Lagrange polynomials using volumes of simplices.
\end{itemize}

\section{Poisedness of interpolation sets}
\label{sec:poisedness}

\subsection{Measuring the well poisedness of interpolation sets}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Definition of the~$\Lambda$-poisedness.
    \item The~$\Lambda$-poisedness measures the quality of the interpolation set.
    \item In practice we do not use it.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Relationship with the conditioning of the interpolation system}

\begin{itemize}
    \item We consider here only the natural basis.
    \item The condition number is bounded by something that depends on~$\Lambda$.
\end{itemize}

\section{Underdetermined interpolation systems}
\label{sec:underdetermined-interpolation}

\begin{itemize}
    \item We focus on quadratic polynomials.
    \item Building a quadratic interpolating model necessitates~$\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ function evaluations.
    \item We want to reduce this number to~$\mathcal{O}(n)$.
    \item Freedom is bequeathed by minimizing a functional that reflects the regularity of the models.
    \item Two examples are given hereafter.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Least Frobenius norm quadratic models}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Factorization of the symmetric Broyden matrix.
    \item Updating the symmetric Broyden matrix.
    \item Decompositions of the Hessian matrices of the quadratic models.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Quadratic models based on symmetric Broyden updates}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Explain the name.
\end{itemize}
